# Relucent Standards

![Relucent Resources, Standards & Best Practices Cover Image](cover.png)

This repository collects and sets out best practices and standards for software
development projects. This repository and the main ideas and resources that it
collects are intended to be project-agnostic, meaning that overall there is
something in this repository for every project. Whilst there may be
language-specific best practices and information there are also general best
practices, resources, and information.

> This repository is a work in progress. You don't have to use this information
> \- this is what we've found works for us - _it might not be what's best for
> you_. If you have any suggestions or ideas, please feel free to open an issue
> or pull request.
