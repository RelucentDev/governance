# The Twelve Factor App

The principles set out by the [Twelve Factor App](https://12factor.net/) are a
great starting point for building modern, scalable, maintainable applications.

The [Twelve Factor App](https://12factor.net/) is a methodology for building
modern, scalable, and maintainable SAAS applications.

- **Codebase**: One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys.
- **Dependencies**: Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies.
- **Config**: Store config in the environment.
- **Backing services**: Treat backing services as attached resources.
- **Build, release, run**: Strictly separate build and run stages.
- **Processes**: Run the app as one or more stateless processes.
- **Port binding**: Export services via port binding.
- **Concurrency**: Scale out via the process model.
- **Disposability**: Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful
  shutdown.
- **Dev/prod parity**: Keep development, staging, and production as similar as
  possible.
- **Logs**: Treat logs as event streams.
- **Admin processes**: Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes.
