# Community Health Files

Based on the needs and purpose of different projects and repositories, it is
advisable to look through [GitHub's Community Health Files
Guidance][gh-community-health] to determine which files are necessary for the
project. Organisation-level community health files may also be used where
relevant.

Additionally, this document describes some of the files that we use in our
projects.

## 1.1. `ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md`

We include an `ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md` file in the root of each project to
acknowledge the contributions of others, and to provide a list of sources of
inspiration and guidance that aren't otherwise obvious in the project.
