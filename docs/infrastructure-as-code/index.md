# Infrastructure as Code (IAC)

Infrastructure as code is a mainstream pattern for managing infrastructure with
configuration files rather than through a graphical user interface or through
manual command line script sequences. It allows you to build, change, and manage
your infrastructure in a safe, consistent, trackable, and repeatable way by
defining resource configurations that you can version (in a version control
system like GitHub), reuse, and share. (HashiCorp, 2023)[^1]

> See more specific documentation for [Terraform](terraform.md).

The use IAC brings the following benefits:

- Cost reduction
- Increase in speed of deployments
- Reduce errors
- Improve infrastructure consistency
- Eliminate configuration drift (Redhat.com, 2024)[^2]
