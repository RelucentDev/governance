# File Signature Comments

Supporting clear project governance, we include file signature comments where
possible to help identify the project, file, and authorship.

We use the following templates when structuring the comments:

```js
/**
 * Project Name.
 *
 * @since     0.0.0
 * @module    Owner\ProjectName
 * @copyright 2023 Author/Owner
 * @author    Author <hello@example.com>
 * @see       https://example.com
 */
```

```css
/*! Project Name | (c) 2023 Author/Owner | https://example.com */
```

```bash
# Project Name.
# (c) 2023 Author/Owner
# https://example.com
```

```html
<!-- Project Name | (c) 2023 Author/Owner | https://example.com -->
```
