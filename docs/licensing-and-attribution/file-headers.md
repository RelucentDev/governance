# File Headers for Licensing and Attribution

## 1. File Comments

Supporting clear project authorship, we include file signature comments where
possible to help identify the project, file, and authorship.

We use the following templates when structuring the comments:

### 1.1. JSDoc

```js
/**
 * Project Name.
 *
 * @copyright 2024 Author/Owner
 * @author    Author <hello@example.com>
 * @see       https://example.com
 */
```

### 1.2. CSS

```css
/*! Project Name | (c) 2024 Author/Owner | https://example.com */
```

### 1.3. Bash, Terraform

```bash
# Project Name.
# (c) 2024 Author/Owner
# https://example.com
```

### 1.4. HTML, XML

```html
<!-- Project Name | (c) 2023 Author/Owner | https://example.com -->
```
